# Browser Metronome

This repository hosts a simple metronome implemented in HTML and JavaScript. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to experiment with tempo, subdivisions, and accent patterns.

The project also contains a small proof-of-concept for notation rendering under `notation_feature/demo.html` using VexFlow.

For details about the internal agents that drive the metronome (tempo, audio, visuals, input, persistence, and logging), see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
